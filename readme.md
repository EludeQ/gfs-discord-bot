# A Gamefromscratch Discord bot!
A Discord bot to quickly test whether Gamefromscratch has covered a certain topic or not.

People often ask on the GFS discord server whether Gamefromscratch has already covered a certain topic or not. Wouldn't it be great if you could just quickly check without going all the way over to Youtube or his site? That's what this bot is for!

## Usage
When the bot is online, type `!check [name of topic here]`, and the bot will automatically look for a GFS Youtube video on the topic.

For example:
![!check libgdx](https://i.imgur.com/AYpcL8B.png)
